# Pagescraping-map
Webmap to display results of pagescraping data - and compare locations to in-house data.

Users select a brand and country filter, the data is then served from a Postgres database via Geoserver. Data can be downloaded from the database in a variety of formats. An on-map comparison of the two locational datasets can be performed, and a PDF report of the comparison can be produced.
